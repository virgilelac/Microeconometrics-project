Download the run files. 
Once it's done, open the run file you want to use.  
Then, just run all the lines. 
Some values are explicitely written to allow for user specific values (for exemple if one wants to check whether we just are lucky with some specific parameters or not). 
The seeds are directly put in the functions because of some coding choices (to avoid worker-specific values, i.e vectors of, say, 10 similar statistics).
