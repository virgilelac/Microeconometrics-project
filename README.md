Once it's done, just put them in the same file and launch the run codes (the ones that have run in it). 
Then, just run all the lines. 
Some values are explicitely written to allow for user specific values (for exemple if one wants to check whether we just are lucky with some specific parameters or not). 
The seeds are directly put in the functions because of some coding choices (to avoid worker-specific values, i.e vectors of, say, 10 similar statistics).
